# 💬 Sentiment Analysis using BERT (Transformer)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for sentiment classification using a pretrained multilingual model from Hugging Face. The model performs real-time sentiment inference and is evaluated on IMDB movie review samples.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Uses pretrained **BERT multilingual sentiment model**
- Hugging Face pipeline for fast and efficient inference
- Classifies real-world text into sentiment categories
- Includes accuracy evaluation on IMDB dataset subset
- Easy to run on **Google Colab (GPU supported)**

## 🧠 Model Used
`nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment`

## 🧪 Evaluation
- Tested on 100 IMDB reviews
- Sentiment score mapping (1–5 stars → Positive/Negative)
- Model performance displayed in notebook output

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python | Transformers | PyTorch | Hugging Face | NLP | Google Colab

## 🔍 Purpose
This project is part of my **AI research portfolio**, demonstr
